# ProjectProposalTemplate
Repository for the project proposal

This repository contains a latex template for your proposal. To build the paper run `make`. In order to do so you will need to have latex installed. [Texlivefull](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-latex-on-ubuntu-20-04-focal-fossa-linux) should be sufficient. 

For your convenience I've included a plotting script with matplotlib to demonstrate how to add a figure into a latex file.
