\section{Proposal}

The body of your proposal. Below are some bullets for questions you should
answers within your proposal. Figure~\ref{fig:example} contains fake information
from a chart that will, with any luck contain some data from a measurement
you've taken. TaMake sure that you adhere to good academic standards and cite all
of the work relate to your project. For example if your project involves
performance isolation on SmartNICs you might want to cite~\cite{fairnic}. See
paper.bib for the format of \LaTeX references. Many academic papers will have
bibtex entries posted near where you can download their pdf's online.
